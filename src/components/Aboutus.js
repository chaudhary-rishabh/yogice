                It all began with a simple realization. Like many of us, we at Yogice were caught in the whirlwind of modern life. Amidst the chaos of busy schedules and endless to-do lists, we noticed something alarming - the so-called "healthy" juices and shakes that were readily available in the market were nothing but a clever disguise for sugar-laden concoctions packaged in plastic bottles loaded with preservatives.
              </p>
              <p className='txt-aboutus'>
                We knew that these supposedly healthy options were far from it. They were a silent contributor to the growing health crisis, and it troubled us. We believed that people deserved better, that there was a need for a healthier alternative that genuinely cared about well-being.

              One of our core principles at Yogice is to eliminate refined sugar from your diet. We understand the harm it can cause, and we refuse to compromise your health. Instead, we sweeten our tea, coffee, and milk with natural alternatives like jaggery and honey. This ensures that you can enjoy your favorite beverages without guilt.
